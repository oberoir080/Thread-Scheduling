# Thread Scheduling (time taken by each thread to perform a task)

This code creates three threads that each perform a loop that counts from 1 to 2^32. The time taken for each thread to complete the loop is calculated and stored in global variables. The code also sets the scheduling policy and priority for each thread, and the time taken by each thread is written to a file in CSV format. Finally, the code waits for all threads to complete and closes the file.
